# NumeralAppBackend

Code in roman.js is directly copied from the frontend version. One way to share code between projects would be turning it into an npm package.

# run
### install node.js > 10 and npm
### npm start

# Docker

### docker build -t devname/roman-backend .
### docker run -p 49160:3000 -d devname/roman-backend
### Use postman or some other way to access localhost:49160
